<h2>Teenage manic delusions</h2>
<p>"Teenage Manic Delusion" is an alternate historical project based on the delusions of author Snowy's bipolar disorder. <br>
The original case is a 3,300-word novel, as well as concept art and games. <br>
Exotic dual male protagonist settings, including love, war, money, emotions. <br>
Snowy started this plan in 2013. After nearly 10 years of repeated adjustments, he started writing the original plan in 2021 and finalized it in 2022. <br>
The purpose of planning is to document the delusion as objectively as possible. Documenting the delusion does not mean that the delusion is real, nor does it mean that the author approves the behavior of the characters in the story. </p>
